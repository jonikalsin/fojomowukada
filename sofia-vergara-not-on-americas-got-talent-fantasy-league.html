In this version, each judge will compete against each other by leading a team they drafted from across the AGT&nbsp;universe. Judges will mentor and guide the acts throughout the competition so that an act from their team will be crowned the AGT: Fantasy League champion. Terry Crews will return as host of the program.</p><p>During the&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;Season 18 finale, fans suggested acts they wanted to compete in&nbsp;Fantasy League. Forty of those acts advanced to the draft pool, and each of the judges selected 10 acts to join their dream team. The coveted <a href=# rel=noopener>Golden Buzzer</a> will continue to be used to send acts to the final round of the competition. Each judge can use their Golden Buzzer for their own act&nbsp;or to steal an act from a fellow judges’ team.</p><p>The America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League judges include Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Mel B.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Sofia Vergara will not be judging the spinoff</a>. Instead, the actress’ seat will be filled by English singer Mel B. Mel B previously judged Seasons 8 through 13 of AGT&nbsp;and Season 1 of&nbsp;AGT: The Champions, so she’s well familiar with the franchise.</p><p>“I did seven years and then in 2019, I came back to the U.K. because Spice Girls was going on tour, and I never went back. I set up home here with my kids and put them in school in my hometown, Leeds. So when I got asked to be back, it just so happened I had a break in my crazy, hectic schedule,” Mel B told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glamour</a> of her return to&nbsp;AGT in December 2023. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is perfect timing.’”</p><p>So, why is Sofia Vergara not on America’s Got Talent Fantasy League?
