She’s an actress as well. [We just saw a movie] and she was really funny in it. But congratulations to her. I know it’s not an easy job!”</p><p></p><p>Upon her departure from the morning show, Angela Yee told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> that the moment had been coming for a “long time” and that there was no animosity between her and her co-hosts.</p><p>“To be clear, I knew this was coming for a long time, for months and months, like probably over six months before we announced it, so while it might have been kind of shocking and out of nowhere for some people, this is something that I knew was going to happen so it’s just a relief to not have to be all secretive about it,” Yee said at the time.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The road to Jess Hilarious joining the program has seemingly been a rocky one. She was a frequent guest host throughout 2023 and actually <a class=underline-link href=#>announced last month that she had been hired permanently</a>.</p><p>However, in the weeks following her announcement, the radio station kept quiet and fans grew confused.
