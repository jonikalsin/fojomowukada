Back in the day, it was commitment first and figure out the rest later. Even in our parents’ generation, a lot of them didn’t even live together first.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shan Boodram (center) with “The Marriage Pact” couples “The Marriage Pact” couples Dennis Phermsin and Maryann Mayo (left) and Grace Ruehle and Marcus Hackett, right. <span class=credit>Fernando Decillis</span></figure><p>“Slow-love courtship is essentially to get as much information as you possibly can before committing,” she said. “These people know each other’s values, history, long-term goals. Often times, they know each other’s extended families.</p><p>“They’ve gathered as much information as possible, but there’s something missing between them,” she said. “Maybe it’s timing, maybe it’s romantic attraction, maybe it’s a fear of commitment. But setting a timestamp for when they will pursue it is really helpful to people who struggle with self-sabotage. Or, maybe a person hasn’t found someone who gives them butterflies, but they have found someone they can have a great and meaningful life with.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shan Boodram with some of “The Marriage Pact” couples, including Dennis Phermsin, Maryann Mayo, and Grace Ruehle. <span class=credit>Fernando Decillis</span></figure><p>The couples include Cody Young and Julie Jackson, 27, who dated in college but broke up when he cheated on her; Armani Vasudeva and Brie Dixon, 30, who have been friends for five years; Dennis Phermsin, 36, and Maryann Mayo, 43, who have been friends for over 20 years but never romantic; Trevor Lyons and Logan Amos, 22, who have been pals since high school; Alysha Munsaka, 27, and&nbsp;Quentin Gause, 30, who have been friends with a spark for years; and Marcus Hackett, 30 and&nbsp;Grace Lewis, 35, flirty pals hindered by long-distance.&nbsp;</p><p>“The timing aspect of love is a huge part of it,” said Boodram.&nbsp;</p><p>“We want to believe that it’s all magic and chemistry, but you can meet somebody where it is a match and you have similar long-term goals, but you both have some growing to do. That doesn’t mean you won’t be with that person eventually.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think everybody has that ‘What if?’ for a friend. So, see what happens when people press play on that ‘What if?’ From a voyeuristic perspective, and a vicarious perspective, everybody has a stake in the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaW1fqLK5vMSrq2armJa7bq7OqJurmZ1ivK951qGcraCVp3qiecyaqauhkZyybrzAnKtmm5Gjeri70aRm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
