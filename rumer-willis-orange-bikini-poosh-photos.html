The sisters were no doubt enjoying a little rest and relaxation to keep their mind off their father&nbsp;stepping aside from acting because of his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secret battle with aphasia</a>, which has begun to impair his cognitive abilities. Earlier that day, their mother and Bruce’s ex-wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a>, shared the diagnosis in a post to Instagram, which was signed by the entire family, including little sister <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tallulah</strong></a>, 28, Bruce’s current wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emma Heming,</a></strong>&nbsp;and Bruce and Emma’s daughters,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mabel Ray</strong></a>, 9, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Evelyn Penn</strong></a>, 7.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” the heartbreaking message read. “As a result of this and with much consideration, Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him. This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bruce’s family didn’t specify his symptoms or when he was diagnosed, but the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mayo clinic</a>&nbsp;describes aphasia as “a condition that robs you of the ability to communicate, including speaking, writing and understand language, both verbal and written.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49sZqutnZq%2FbsPIpaOiq12kv6K6xp5km6Gbnruqec%2BopqygXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
