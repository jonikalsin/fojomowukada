We are just a community of veterans and family of the fallen who want to serve in honor of the fallen,” said Molly Barnick, Travis Manion Foundation’s chief strategic communications officer. “The Honor Project actually started two years ago in the height of the pandemic in 2020, and it started because there were so many families who couldn’t get access to the cemetery and couldn’t see their loved one or couldn’t travel.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Anne Donne, who retired from the Army National Guard, was one of the volunteers on Monday who checked in, collected commemorative coins for the Honor Project and placed them on gravesites of fallen heroes.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I did serve in the military.
