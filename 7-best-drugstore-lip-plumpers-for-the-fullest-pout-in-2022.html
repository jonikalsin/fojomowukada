The slightly terrifying name referred to a middle schooler-beloved lip gloss that promised to give “bee stung lips” to anyone who wanted to have a pout like Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johannson. Along with Too Faced Lip Injection, drugstore lip plumpers (as well as luxury brand lip plumpers) like Lip Venom began gaining popularity over the years, helping to usher in more products that promised fuller lips.</p><p><span class="px-e17 bg-white inline">In This Article</span></p><ul class="table-of-contents-list list-none mt-e25 mb-0 md:mb-e25" readability=23><li class="flex text-link text-left mb-e25" readability=24><p>01</p><p><span class=bookmark-name>Jump to best drugstore lip plumpers<span></span></span></p></li></ul><h2>So what exactly is lip plumper and what does it do?</h2><p>“Lip plumper helps lips appear full and voluminous,” explains Manuel Espinoza, StyleSeat Makeup Artist. “When applied, there is a slight burning and tingling sensation due to mild irritants that are often used in lip plumper formulas,” Espinoza adds. (These mild irritants include ingredients such as cinnamon, menthol, or capsaicin, which is found in hot peppers like cayenne.) Espinoza points out that lip plumper works by slightly irritating your lips, which causes an increase of blood flow, leading them to appear plumper, due to the swelling. “Some lip plumpers may contain bee venom, so be wary if you are allergic to bees or have sensitive skin,” he says, adding that it’s also important to apply a moisturizing lip balm beforehand, as lip plumper can dry out your lips. (Hey, they’re still a safer option than that scary Kylie Jenner challenge a few years back. Remember that?)</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Full, juicy lips are trendier now than ever, and while many more people these days opt for getting lip injections than during the aughts, there are still many who crave the look—but would rather go for an alternative approach.
