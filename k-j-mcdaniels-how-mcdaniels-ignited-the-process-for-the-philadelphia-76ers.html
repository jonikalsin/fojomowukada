 Early Life and Career As a sophomore forward for the Clemson Tigers McDaniels got his start, showing off his skills on a very specific court - his university.
He broke out as one of the best players in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in his junior year and averaged a monster 17."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

J." McDaniels Jr.,&nbsp;was very&nbsp;underrated player that&nbsp;had a huge role in the NBA, but often went unnoticed in "The Process," of the Philadelphia Sixers.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Early Life and Career</h2><p>As a sophomore forward for the Clemson Tigers McDaniels got his start, showing off his skills on a very specific court - his university.</p><p>He broke out as one of the best players in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in his junior year and averaged a monster 17.2 points, 7.1 rebounds, and led the entire ACC in blocks per game (2.9).</p><p>On top of that, he won the ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and was a First-team All-ACC.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>NBA Draft & 76ers</h2><p>McDaniels was selected in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft, 32nd overall by the Philadelphia 76ers.</p><p>He made a quick impression as one of the Sixers' key reserve players almost from the jump and drew notice for his shot-blocking ability. In his rookie season, he posted his first career double-double by scoring a season-high 21 points with 13 rebounds against the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p>His tenure with the 76ers was brief, but he showed great promise before being traded to the Houston Rockets.</p><p>When he left the 76ers, it was part of the organization's transition and paved the way for the arrival of incoming future stars in Joel Embiid.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Rockets and Beyond</h2><p>McDaniels then spent time with the 76ers, Houston Rockets, and the Brooklyn Nets. Most recently, he briefly played for both the Grand Rapids Drive and the Oklahoma City Blue.</p><p>While his time in the NBA had its hiccups, be it injuries, and new teammates, McDaniels never gave up on playing professional ball.</p><p>As McDaniels' NBA trek was put on pause, he was given a chance to resuscitate his career in the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL).</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Impact</h2><p>McDaniels was also a significant part of the 76ers' trek through the start of "The Process", in 2015. His imprint, even if short-lived, set the foundation for The Process's ascension and the eventual rise to stardom from people like Joel Embiid.</p><p>It's a tale of the perseverance and flexibility that life out on the professional sports circuit demands.</p><p>So to sum up, the K. J. McDaniels college glorifies and permits him to be a potential international star that he always was on NCAA and NBA floors.</p><p>His unsung but effective career with the Philadelphia 76ers supports that and he has always shown a willingness to accept any challenge that has come his way.</p><p>While he continues to impress overseas, the career of the heralded talent that almost was is a testament to the unique tapestry of basketball lore that always hangs above the sport.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfoHqrecycm5qmmZq5tHnHqK5mpZOZrq%2B1xKWqZqGXo7a1scNmq6GdXaW%2FsK%2FErKpmnp%2BnerW0xGanoaGclrGmuM%2BhoJplZ2uys78%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
