In addition, he follows Christianity and his zodiac sign is Aquarius.</p><p>Moving on towards his family members, he was born to his father David Ponder, and his mother Christine Ponder. His father was also a football player who played for Florida State in his college days. According to Christian, his dad influenced him to make a career in football. In terms of his educational status, he did his schooling at Colleyville Heritage High School. Then, he joined Florida State University and is one of their most valuable offensive players. He graduated from the university with a degree in finance.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life_and_Career>Professional Life and Career</span></h2><p>Christian started his football career in college.

The team lost the match with Chicago Bears but the players of Chicago were impressed by Ponder’s performance. He missed the week four game against Pittsburgh due to a rib injury. Therefore, he had a disappointing 2013 season. This is why his future with Viking fell in doubt. Though the team rendered him to third-string quarterback, he still wished to stay with the Vikings. However, Vikings chose not to extend his contract, he left Vikings in 2015.</p><p>Ponder signed a one-year contract with Oakland Raiders in March 2013. After preseason, Oakland released him.
