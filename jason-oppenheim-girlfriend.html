Jason and his twin brother Brett were on vacation at the time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jason said about how they met: “I liked that she hadn’t seen the show, so she didn’t know who I was or about my relationship with Chrishell.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Marie-Lou and Jason’s first walk down the red carpet was at the opening of Netflix’s Day Shift in August 2022.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Before he started dating Marie-Lou, Jason dated Chrishell Stause, who worked with him and was also one of his co-stars. At the end of season 5, Jason told Chrishell that he didn’t want to have children, which was a deal-breaker for Chrishell.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jason’s feelings have changed since he started dating someone new. He says, “Right now, I’m more interested in being a husband than a father. I like that Lou doesn’t make me feel like I have to have a child or even think about it. It makes things easy for us.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Marie-Lou says in season 6 that she doesn’t want kids until she’s in her late 30s. This gives the couple a lot of time before they start a family.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>Are Jason Oppenheim And Marie-Lou Still Together?</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>It looks like Jason and Marie-Lou’s relationship is going well.</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Brett and a few other friends joined them in Australia to ring in the new year.
