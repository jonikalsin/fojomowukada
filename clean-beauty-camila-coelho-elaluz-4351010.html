Between her trend-setting <strong>Camila Coelho Collection</strong> to her recently launched <strong>Elaluz</strong> skincare and beauty brand, the Brazilian stunner continues to be a leader among several industries. Elaluz, which Camila calls her “best career moment to date,” means “She is light” in the entrepreneur’s native language of Portuguese and is a lifestyle brand that starts with essential beauty products and will cover different categories of hair, makeup, body and skincare.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“My main goal was to create a mindfully, luxurious and clean brand including everything from the packaging to the formulas. Beauty consumers shop from multiple brands, so I wanted to focus on releasing my must-have items,” Camila explained in an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>. ”&nbsp;<span class=markj9a38ia8g data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Elaluz</span> is an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on-the-go lifestyle brand,</a> driven by the key products I carry and each product is designed to be a partner in the daily hustle, making life a little easier for power and confident people on the go.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Headshot-courtesy-of-Raul-Romo.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The clean, sustainable brand, made without parabens, sulfates, phthalates, PEGs, TEA, DEA or GMO, has a number of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fan-fave products</a>, and continues to have monthly drops of new beauty essentials. Here, Camila shares her top 6 picks from Elaluz, which she uses to get her perfectly smooth skin and perfect make-up looks!</p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow>Lip & Cheek Stain</a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>I love beauty, but I also love to keep things as simple as possible. I wanted to create an ultra-blendable, customizable stain that works for both cheeks and lips. The red shade is really universal and layers in an effortless way – so you really have full control over your look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Camila-Coelho-Elaluz-embed5.jpg alt width=402 height=467 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow><b>Beauty Oil</b></a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>This is one of my favorite products I’ve created! <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Skincare</a> always comes first for me – it’s got to be a good canvas for my makeup. My struggle with oils has always been the texture and heaviness of the product. I wanted to create an oil with the most natural, powerful Brazilian ingredients that was lightweight and non-irritating without giving up hydration and nutrients. This one works wonders under makeup or all by itself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Camila-Coelho-Elaluz-embed4.jpg alt width=398 height=519 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow>All Day Beauty Water</a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>This is a super rich, hydrating face mist that you can use in so many different ways. I love to use it to prep my skin for makeup, to set my makeup with a boost of radiance or as a refresh throughout the day. I wanted this product to be versatile in use but also have major skincare benefits, so I included a ton of Brazilian superfood ingredients to help tone skin and refine the look of pores.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BeautyWater_DSC9081.jpg alt width=399 height=554 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow>Overnight Facial Glow</a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>I’m the type of person that wants a glow all year round, not just in the summer so I wanted to make a self tanner I could use really often that wouldn’t dry out my skin and actually help to&nbsp;<i>improve</i>&nbsp;it overtime. Plus, the color is really buildable so you can customize to your liking.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Camila-Coelho-Elaluz-embed1.jpg alt width=397 height=596 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow>24K Lip Therapy</a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>A no-color lip hydrator has always been a must have for me so when I created this formula I wanted to make sure it could be used in every way I dreamed of. I use this product as part of my morning skincare routine, throughout the day over lip color or on it’s own, and my favorite way – as an overnight lip mask to wake up with super soft lips.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Camila-Coelho-Elaluz-embed2.jpg alt width=397 height=530 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow>Brazilian Goddess Palette</a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>My makeup collection is FULL of eyeshadow palettes and I have always mixed and matched palettes to find all the best shades. I wanted to create my own version of rich, velvety favorites together in one palette for a go-to collection of eyeshadows that are Brazil inspired, super soft and glowy and great for day or night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Camila-Coelho-Elaluz-embed3.jpg alt width=399 height=499 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGiqoaegZLCtscCnZJudkarBunnCmqSipJFisLCxy6GmZp2clrm2xoxtam5pYGZ9cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
