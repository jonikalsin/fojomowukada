No one should live in fear in our city.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Oakland police investigate the scene after shooting an armed carjacking suspect on International Boulevard and 105th Avenue in East Oakland, Calif., on Feb. 17, 2023. <span class=credit>MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The group, along with Bishop Bob Jackson of the Acts Full Gospel Church, said Price’s unwillingness to charge and prosecute serious criminals, <a href=#>as reported by The Post</a>, has created “the proliferation of anti-police rhetoric and created a heyday for Oakland criminals.”</p><p>The city’s 911 system also is failing its residents, while criminals know police response is usually slow since the city is suffering from a shortage of 500 officers, Oakland NAACP officials said in the letter.</p><p>As of July 16, robberies in Oakland have increased by 22% with 1,880 reports, <a href=#>according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.

Women are targeted by young mobs and viciously beaten and robbed in downtown and uptown neighborhoods.</p><p>“Asians are assaulted in Chinatown. Street vendors are robbed in Fruitvale.
