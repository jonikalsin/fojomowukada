Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain any information on Emily’s father. I’m also undecided about whether or not her parents are still together.</p><p>She hasn’t spoken anything about her sister or brother, either. She appears to be of white ethnicity and of Australian nationality, in my opinion.</p><h2>Emily Scott Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Emily Scott</strong> has a Koi fish tattoo on her right arm, which she received while competing in the program London Ink.

They didn’t connect on a deeper level, and in September of 2014, they decided to end their relationship.</p><p>Emily was devastated when she learned of Shane’s untimely death. She paid respect to him on her official Instagram profile by penning an emotional message for him. She also shared a photo of the two while they were dating.</p><p>Emily had previously been married to a man named Ritchie Neville. He works as a sommelier, restaurant, and vocalist in his spare time.
