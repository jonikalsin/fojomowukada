As he sifted through the rest of the hamper, he was shocked to discover several more letters that had been written between 1942 and 1944.</p><p>“I was getting ready for my route and found some letters that were dated back to 1942, so World War II,” Gauthier, who has been a postal worker for about 20 years, told <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC affiliate KXAS-TV</a>. “Being a veteran myself, so I’m like man, this is some history! Because once again, mail boosts morale for all soldiers, so my main thought was I have to find this family.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-487940 alt="Jo Ann Smith And Marion Lamb" width=744 height=894 data-sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/joann-smith-and-marion-lamb.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-487940 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Lamb Family</span><span class=caption-body>Jo Ann Smith and Marion Lamb.

But he had just a couple of clues to work with. The letters revealed the soldier’s name, Marion Lamb, as well as the recipient’s address in Jacksonville, Arkansas.</p><p>After he found Marion Lamb’s obituary online, Gauthier reached out to a local television station in Jacksonville and told the story of how he’d found the letters in his postal hamper. Shortly after the segment aired, he was contacted by 84-year-old Jo Ann Smith — Lamb’s younger sister.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-487934 alt="Marion Lamb" width=700 height=933 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marion-lamb.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-487934 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Lamb Family</span><span class=caption-body>Marion Lamb was in the military from 1941 to 1945 and fought in the South Pacific.</span></p><p>After speaking with Smith, Gauthier learned about how the letters had gotten lost.

The nephew had mailed them and other letters to his Texas-based cousin, Debbie Smith, who was considered the family historian. But when they arrived, the package sealing had broken — and some of the letters had apparently fallen out.</p><p>Having solved the mystery, Gauthier offered to return the letters to Jo Ann Smith, who lives in Arkansas.</p><p>“I could have stuck them in the mail, but it’s kinda like sometimes you have to go above and beyond,” Gauthier told KXAS-TV. “Just go the extra mile… or 379 miles.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-487942 alt="Alvin Gauthier And Marion Lamb's Family" width=800 height=735 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/alvin-gauthier-and-marion-lambs-family.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-487942 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Debbie Smith</span><span class=caption-body>Alvin Gauthier and Marion Lamb’s family.</span></p><p>On his day off and using his own money, Gauthier drove five hours to Arkansas to deliver Marion Lamb’s letters in person. Gauthier, Jo Ann Smith, and Debbie Smith —&nbsp;who also traveled to Arkansas for the occasion — read the letters together.</p><p>Since then, Alvin Gauthier and Marion Lamb’s family have stayed in touch.</p><p>“It restores your faith in people,” Debbie Smith told KXAS-TV. “And we saw the connection, the real connection, between military families.”</p><p>After reading about how a postal worker drove five hours to deliver letters written during World War II, discover these astonishing <a href=#>facts about World War II</a>.
