You must remember this child if you have seen the Shriners Children’s Hospital advertising. Alec was born with a rare congenital condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta, which translates to “weak bone illness.” Alec’s parents took him to the hospital when he was just two months old because they realized there was something different about their child. After all, he was not normal like other children.</p><p>The physicians informed Alec’s mother that he had brittle bone disease, an uncommon condition. Your bones break readily, as they do in this condition. This sickness is only found in a few persons. Alec, on the other hand, is a positive person who hasn’t given up hope despite fracturing bones more than 60 times.</p><p>When he was 12 years old, a member of The Shriner’s hospital approached him and asked him to appear in their advertisement. Cabacungan was initially hesitant to take on the acting role because he was afraid that his friends or classmates would mock him; however, hospital personnel persuaded him to do so after telling him that by doing so, people who are unaware of this rare disease would be educated, and those who are suffering from it would be inspired. As a result, he agreed and attempted to be a part of the commercial advertisement.</p><p>When Alec Cabacungan went on vacation after a few months, no one noticed him because he had no idea the advertisement was a major success. So he was satisfied after that.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Alec Cabacungan’s bodily shape, as well as his height and weight, are still unknown.
