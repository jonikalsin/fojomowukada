Unfortunately for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kenya Moore</strong></a>, her plus one backed out at the last minute, so she started off the trip by her lonesome. However, that didn‚Äôt last very long because shortly after arriving in Jamaica, she met a guy and invited him to the cast dinner later that night.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kandi & Todd get into it with Marlo! üî• <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#RHOA</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/lutOFbt2Ge</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>‚Äî jay (@JaysRealityBlog) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 8, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Once at the dinner, the cast interrogated Kenya‚Äôs date ‚Äî they asked him how old he was, and Kenya made him blush by joking about his private parts. But he also didn‚Äôt stay long because before the food was even served, <strong>Marlo</strong> <strong>Hampton</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kandi Burruss</strong></a> got into a huge argument.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It all started when someone asked <strong>Ralph Pittman</strong> to talk about the book he‚Äôs writing. That led to Marlo asking him whether he‚Äôs adopting Drew Sidora‚Äôs son. He originally said he would, but after a conversation with the boy‚Äôs biological father, he decided not to move forward with the adoption. Drew already knew he had made this decision, but Marlo started causing drama over it, and it rubbed everyone the wrong way. Especially Kandi, who told Marlo to butt out of the conversation since she recently kicked her two nephews out of her house ‚Äî in Kandi‚Äôs eyes, Marlo isn‚Äôt the best person to be giving parenting advice.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Grammy winner, actress on a Showtime series, Broadway producer, The Masker Singer winner, Xscape, Big Brother, 10 million Instagram followers, restaurants. *THAT* is how Kandi cleared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#RHOA</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/nGwo1X6or9</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>‚Äî Queens of Bravo (@queensofbravo) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 8, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kandi‚Äôs comment caused an even bigger uproar, and Marlo soon took a few hits at Kandi. First, she said that Kandi prioritizes her mom over husband Todd. And then, she said that Kandi is ‚Äúonly known in Atlanta‚Äù. That really pissed Kandi off, as she screamed back that she‚Äôs known ‚Äúworldwide‚Äù. And that wasn‚Äôt even the end of the dinner ‚Äî more is coming next week, so we imagine things will only get worse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Want more drama?
