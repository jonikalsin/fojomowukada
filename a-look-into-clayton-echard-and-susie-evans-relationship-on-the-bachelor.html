The pair, who are now residing in Virginia, want to relocate to other places and maintain a long-distance romance.&nbsp;The reality star stated his intention to relocate to Arizona, while his girlfriend Susie would go to Los Angeles. Clayton said on Dear Media’s Not Skinny but Not Fat podcast:</p><p>“We’re now in Virginia Beach, but our next step is for me to go to Scottsdale, and she to relocate to Los Angeles in the meantime.”</p><h2>Clayton and Susie’s relationship on The Bachelor takes a new turn.</h2><p>After getting Susie back after The Bachelor, the pair chose to live together. They have opted to live separately in various places and have a long-distance relationship after spending a few months under one roof in Clayton’s hometown of Virginia Beach. During his interview with the podcast, he stated:</p><p>“We’re like, ‘We don’t know whether this is going to be a month-long [relationship] or if it’s going to be a lifelong connection, but there’s no pressure.” Let us just love and be glad for one another.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clayton-Echard-2.jpg alt="Clayton Echard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The two are relocating to separate places in order to pursue their ambitions and objectives. When asked about the location, he stated:</p><p>“We’re just a 50-minute flight away, but we’re both following our ambitions, and I believe location-wise, those are the places we want to be.”</p><p>He also claimed that Susie suggested living apart since he had a demanding work schedule. He stated:</p><p>“I mean, I’m on my computer 10 to 12 hours a day.” So she said, ‘Clayton, I’ll go to L.A., and then we can see each other on weekends.’ And we’ll see what happens. We’re not sure whether we’ll like the lengthy drive.”</p><h2>The Bachelor pair is doing well.</h2><p>Regardless of the distance, Clayton and Susie will do all they can to make their long-distance romance work, as the former thinks.</p><p>“A little more space never hurts.”</p><p>He even thinks that “distance makes the heart grow fonder,” but if they feel that the distance is affecting their relationship, one partner will switch with another. In terms of the future, he stated:</p><p>“She has her own ambitions and objectives. And we’re going to give it a go. If it doesn’t work and we decide, ‘We don’t like this distance, it’s hurting us,’ one of us will move in with the other.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clayton-Echard-3.webp alt="Clayton Echard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After season 26 of The Bachelor, the pair married. The Bachelor confessed in one of the episodes that he is in love with her and two other finalists, Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey. Susie abruptly exited the stage after the news stunned all three females.&nbsp;He opted not to give the last rose to any of the remaining ladies after much drama and consideration. Instead, once The Bachelor concluded, he returned to win Susie. They ultimately got acquainted and moved in together.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmabnJbGtbvNZpycoJGnsW6tzZ1krK2jnrJusdWapaxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlerC6jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
