I engineer, I write the music and I mix in my house. What I learned from Def Jam — because I’m a Def Jam baby — I learned all my tutelage on how to put out music through Def Jam.</p><p>“The only thing now that’s missing is me having a date and me rushing when they want me to put it out. I’m able to move on my own time. Last time I talked to you, I thought I was ready, but I wasn’t. A couple of months ago, I knew I was ready to put the album out, but COVID hit. I’m like, ‘I want to be able to be out there to promote the album, not sit from a couch doing interviews.’”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/04/AF8C3E77-E1F5-401D-BB6B-0044F2B9B544-e1650454620622.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Redman Will Educate The Masses As New Executive Producer & Director Of 'The Dab Roast'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 20, 2022</p></a><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Redman</a>&nbsp;was actually grateful the<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic</a>&nbsp;allowed him to fine tune the album.
