He then worked for WJW-TV, a CBS affiliate from 1960 to 1962, where he appeared in a weekday morning film show called Ernie’s Place, and wrote materials for comic skits during film intermissions. Conway and Anderson also collaborated on a comedy album during this time. However, WJW-TV dismissed Conway in 1962 for misleading management about his experience as a director, which resulted in Anderson hosting a horror film show on Friday nights instead. Conway continued to appear on Cleveland television periodically after becoming famous, including on the Hoolihan and Big Chuck and Big Chuck and Lil’ John shows on WJW-TV. He also made guest appearances at various “Ghoulardifest” events, along with other Cleveland TV personalities in tribute to Ernie Anderson, who passed away in 1997.</p><h2 id=biography_of_tim_conway class=smooth-goto>Biography of Tim Conway&nbsp;</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody readability=11.5><tr><td><strong>SPECIFICATIONS&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>DETAILS&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Born</td><td>Thomas Daniel Conway<p>December 15, 1933</p><p>Willoughby, Ohio, U.S.</p></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Died</td><td readability=7>May 14, 2019 (aged 85)<p>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</p></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Resting place</td><td>Westwood Village Memorial Park, Westwood, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Other names</td><td>Tim Daniel Conway<p>Thomas Conway</p><p>Toma Daniel Conway</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Alma mater</td><td>Bowling Green State University</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Occupations</td><td><ul><li><p>Actor</p></li><li><p>comedian</p></li><li><p>writer</p></li><li><p>director</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouses</td><td readability=5>Mary Anne Dalton -​(m. 1961; div. 1978)​<p>Charlene Fusco Del Sardo Beatty –<br>​(m. 1984)​</p></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
