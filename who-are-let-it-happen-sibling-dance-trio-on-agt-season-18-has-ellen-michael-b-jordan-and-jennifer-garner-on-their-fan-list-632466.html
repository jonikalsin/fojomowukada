The talented trio have got the social media spotlight after repeatedly going viral for their in-sync dance videos. They are known for inspiring the young and old generation alike with their amazing routines. Let It Happen has toured Europe, Asia, and the US.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Netflix Christmas movie 'Family Switch' starring Jennifer Garner sparks outrage over depiction of 'unnecessary incest' scene</a></p><h2 class=split>Who are Let It Happen?</h2><p>Norah, Yarah, and Rosa grew up dancing together to the R&B and hip-hop music their parents played at home in the Netherlands. However, it was around five years ago that the trio decided to brand themselves as Let It Happen. Notably, there's an interesting story behind the moniker. Prior to one of the many international dance contests they've competed in, Norah, Yarah and Rosa's father gave them a motivational speech. He said, "Guys, don't worry, just let it happen!" and that became the sibling group's name. Norah, Yarah, and Rosa have a professional dance instructor in Paris. But they choreograph each routine on their own, which makes them all the more impressive. Let It Happen garnered global attention for the first time when they danced to James Brown's hit song 'Get on the Good Foot' to honor the late Godfather of Soul's birthday. The video raked in millions of views and was even reposted by Brown's official Facebook page, increasing their reach even further. Since then, they never looked back and continued to mark new milestones.</p><p>Furthermore, Let It Happen has a huge fan base which also includes multiple A-list Hollywood celebrities. Their dancing videos have been shared by Alicia Keys, Viola Davis, Michael B Jordan, Jennifer Garner, and Janet Jackson. Norah, Yarah, and Rosa have also appeared on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' twice. They have also virtually performed during Lollapalooza, the Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy broadcast, and the Disney Channel Summer Sing-Along special. Additionally, Norah, Yarah and Rosa's social media fame brought collaborations with big-name brands like Netflix, Coca-Cola, Nike, Good American, and Moncler.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Jennifer Garner has no desire to revisit past like her character in 'Family Switch', says 'I'll stay right here'</a></p><h2 class=split>Let It Happen on 'America's Got Talent' Season 18</h2><p>Norah, Yarah, and Rosa are all set to appear in the upcoming episode of 'America's Got Talent' Season 18.
