He has generated billions of dollars in revenue and stayed undefeated during his professional career. Outside of his illustrious career, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayweather</a> has also had quite a few run-ins with the law. The same can be said about his eldest daughter,<strong> Iyanna Mayweather</strong>,<strong> </strong>who was arrested in 2020.</p><p>Floyd Mayweather’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eldest daughter</a> was previously in a relationship with a famous rapper,<strong> NBA YoungBoy, </strong>and have a son together. However, NBA YoungBoy was also with another woman named <strong>Lapattra Jacobs </strong>who also had a kid with the rapper. The rapper and Jacobs were at his Houston home together when Iyanna Mayweather arrived. She was upset about Jacobs being at the residence, as Mayweather was still dating YoungBoy at the time. This resulted in a verbal dispute between Mayweather and Jacobs, which escalated into a physical altercation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Iyanna then stabbed Jacobs with two knives from the kitchen and later was charged with aggravated assault. Jacobs was rushed to the nearby hospital and recounted the transpired incident. According to Iyanna, the whole alteration began due to Jacobs pulling her hair outside the house prior to the stabbing. Iyanna Mayweather’s attorney further added that they believed Mayweather was simply defending herself from being attacked.</p><p>Although Iyanna was looking at 20 years behind bars for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, she managed to escape jail time. Iyanna pleaded guilty to the stabbing and entered a plea agreement to avoid prison. According to the agreement, she is under a special form of judge-ordered probation and has a set of rules she must abide by.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Only moments after John Gotti beef, Floyd Mayweather awarded with Black History Month ‘Juneteenth’ belt</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-iyanna-mayweather-dragged-into-floyd-mayweather-and-john-gotti-iii-s-beef>Iyanna Mayweather dragged into Floyd Mayweather and John Gotti III’s beef</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Floyd-Mayweathers-daughter-threatened-by-Nicolette-Gotti-1024x768.jpg><p>The fallout from Floyd Mayweather’s recent bout with <strong>John Gotti III</strong> had many repercussions for both fighters. The fight ended up in disqualification due to John’s antics, and the referee stopped the bout. Despite the stoppage, Gotti shoved the referee aside and continued to charge at Mayweather. This led to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brawl in the ring </a>between the camps of both fighters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>After the bout, Floyd Mayweather was put on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Italian mob’s hitlist</a> as John Gotti III declared Mayweather his enemy for life. However, the beef did not end between the two. Gotti III’s sister <strong>Nicolette Gotti</strong> threatened Mayweather’s daughter Iyanna Mayweather. “Your daughter was ran through by a animal with 12 different baby mamas – your little circus animal – you’re all a pack of zoo animals. I swear on my kids I’m coming for your daughter, it may be 2 years, 3 years from now but I’m coming c***,” posted Nicolette on her Instagram story.</p><p>Apart from threatening Iyanna, she also dragged rapper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA YoungBoy</a> who was previously in a relationship with Iyanna. Given John Gotti III’s connection with the infamous Gambino crime family, his threats could be very serious. Both John Gotti III and Nicolette are grandchildren of John Gotti, who was the head of the Gambino Crime Family in the past.</p><p><strong>In case you missed :</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57waivoqaXYrumw9JmrqGdnmKzrbvYnWSmmamssqLAx56pZpyRqrSpwMSrZLCZo2K3orXLnptmmZapsrN50q2Ym5yfoq6qur5wZJqkpJq%2FpK3ToqanZaeewal50ZqnqZ2iYrujrYyypq6ml5e8uns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
