When the couple were linked the blonde bombshell said that she was surprised at being matched with Matt. Adrienne entered the show as an “intruder bride” over a couple of weeks.</p><p>Adrienne classes herself as “fiercely independent,” and after “having recently lost a life-changing eight stone, is full of a newfound confidence.”</p><p>A spokesman for Married at First Sight UK said: “Feeling she’s run out of dating options in rural Cumbria, Adrienne is on the hunt for a worthy man. Having left the family home at 15, she’s always been fiercely independent, but now is looking for someone equally self-driven she can share a future with. She now knows what she deserves and won’t settle for anything less. Having recently lost a life-changing eight stone, Adrienne is full of newfound confidence and ready to meet her perfect partner.”</p><p>Her partner Matt also opened up about joining the experiment. He told the Stray Ferret: “I went into the process not knowing what to expect but I gave it my best shot. Putting your trust in the experts knowing they will match you up with someone you want is a scary thought.”</p><p>Due to his late arrival on the show, Matt will be viewed as an “intruder groom”—a persona created to maybe attract attention as well as fall in love. He continued: “It was one of the most intense experiences of my life, but also one of the best, and a journey I’ll never forget. Expect lots of laughs, drama, and downfalls that get rebuilt through the show.”</p><h3><strong>Adrienne Naylor Age</strong></h3><p>In May 2023, Adrienne Naylor turned 27 years old.</p><h3><strong>Adrienne Naylor Parents</strong></h3><p>One of Adrienne Naylor’s parents is her mother Annie Banks.

She compared it to a photo of herself wearing black waistline leggings with a blue crop top pulled down to show off her impressive abs.</p><p>In her caption, Adrienne wrote: “Motivation for the week ahead, keep pushing.

I’m happy, content & FULL😂 6 & 1/2 stone down. I gained some Christmas beef, which I was struggling to get back off. Having such a bad relationship with food, I was either eating too little or bingeing.
