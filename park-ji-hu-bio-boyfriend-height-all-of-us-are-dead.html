Our star, Park Ji-hu portrayed one of the survivors there named “On-jo,” who joined forces with other students to take on the mass of the brain-eating creatures.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, who is she? Get to know her real-life details as this Park Ji-hu Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Park Ji-hu On All of Us Are Dead</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Park Ji-hu’s character “On-jo” is one of the students of Hyosan High School where a deadly virus outbreak turned almost all of the students into zombies. So, trapped without any food, cell phone service, or adults, she and other teenagers struggle to survive, all while hoping that someone is on the way to rescue them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But thanks to the survival knowledge gained from her firefighter dad, On-jo can keep her composure. Moreover, besides saving herself, this fighter lady was also able to save a few of her friends out of there alive.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The plot is similar to that of the popular South Korean zombie horror film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Train From Busan</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and we’re not the only one who thinks so. As seen in the trailer, one of the characters in the series references the film as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This season, Park was joined by co-stars — <a href=#>Yoon Chan-young</a> (Chung-san), <a href=#>Cho Yi-hyun</a> (Nam-ra), Park Solomon (Lee Soo-hyuk), Yoo In-soo (Yoon Gwi-nam), and Shin Jae-hwi (Chang-hoon).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most of them including Park is likely a new face to you.
