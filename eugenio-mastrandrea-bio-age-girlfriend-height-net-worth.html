A month ahead, and we are already in love with its trailer and its gorgeous cast <a href=#>Zoe Saldaña</a> (of Avatar) and Eugenio Mastrandrea.</p><p>Meanwhile, the writing below is about Eugenio, a relative newcomer, with not just his devilish handsomeness but also the exceptional skills of an ideal actor. Here’s what we know about him.</p><h3><strong>Eugenio Mastrandrea On Netflix’s From Scratch</strong></h3><p>In Netflix’s limited series From Scratch, the enchantment of Italia helps two strangers from different sides of the globe fall deeply in love. It stars Zoe Saldaña as Amahle “Amy” Wheeler, a Texan artist and student desperate to embark on an international journey. As the story continues, we see what happens when she has a chance run-in with a handsome Sicilian chef named Lino played by none other than Eugenio Mastrandrea.</p><p>Eugenio’s character is a talented cook who somehow can not make it in his line of work.</p><p>So far, the trailer shows that this story, inspired by the New York Times Bestselling Memoir of the same name by Tembi Locke, is a lot more than a romantic comedy, spanning from the first “hello” until marriage, the “in sickness” part, and even the birth of a child. The on-screen daughter Idalia, is played by child actor Isla Colbert.</p><p>Also so you know, the 1st of September in 2021 was the last day of the shooting of this drama limited series created by Attica Locke and Tembi Locke. The TV series is also notably produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine.</p><p>Other than Eugenio and Zoe, the series also stars Danielle Deadwyler, Keith David, Kellita Smith, Judith Scott, Lucia Sardo, Paride Benassai, and Roberta Rigano.</p><h3><strong>Eugenio Mastrandrea’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Eugenio Mastrandrea’s net worth is reportedly an estimated $500 thousand as of 2022.</p><p>As of July of 2022, he was studying at the Liceo Español Cervantes and the British School in Rome, in his hometown, where he hoped to improve his knowledge of Spanish and English.</p><p>Before this, Eugenio made his debut on the big screen at a very young age in the cult film ACAB directed by Stefano Sollima. Later on, he graduated from the National Academy of Dramatic Art “Silvio D’amico”.</p><p>He has acted in many plays with directors such as Robert Wilson in “HamletMachine” and Emma Dante in “Le Baccanti”. And just before From Scratch, he was the male protagonist of the Rai series La Fuggitiva directed by Carlo Carlei.</p><p>Eugenio also tried his hand as a theater director, signing Face to Face with La Contessa in 2015 and La Contessa tra i Sessi in 2018.</p><p>As of 2022, he was managed by Jacopo De Luca of JDL Management, a talent agency, and movie theatre. Also so&nbsp;far, IMDB credited Eugenio mostly for A.C.A.B. – All Cops Are Bastards (2012), From Scratch (2022), and Nero a metà (2018).</p><h3><strong>Is Eugenio Mastrandrea Gay?</strong></h3><p>Eugenio Mastrandrea had not yet revealed his sexual orientation. But, it seemed most of his fans anyway have believed that he is straight.</p><h3><strong>Does Eugenio Mastrandrea Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Eugenio Mastrandrea had not himself revealed, as of the time of this writing, if he was or not dating anyone. So, his relationship status was unclear at the moment.</p><p>His social media also does not help us as he rarely puts anything close to his personal life on them. He only started sharing on Instagram as of 30 April 2021 and by mid-September 2022, there were no more than 9 posts. And everything he posted as of the date was strictly about either the character he played in films/TV and theatre or something his profession-related.</p><p>Eugenio even had not disclosed anything about his family. So, it is as of now, understandable that he also chose to keep his romantic life out of the limelight (if he had any).</p><p>Also, if in case some of you were wondering if he is dating his&nbsp;From Scratch, the answer would be a big ‘no’. Because Zoe Saldana is not already in a relationship, she is actually married. She married Marco Perego, her boyfriend since March 2013, in June 2013.
